# epl 0.2.4

* Fix broken link to EPL Parvo Shiny App in the README.
* Add an image of the 9-panel plot implemented in the app. 

# epl 0.2.3

* Attach example `parvo_excel.xlsx`. Documented in `data.R`
    * For test coverage of excel files.
    * And test coverage of *"economy"* and *"GE"* metabolic calculations.
* Update `example_epl()` to avoid error on open files with *"~"*.
* Minor update to `read_parvo()` to remove some redundant code.
* Update `test_that` coverage for `example_epl()` and `read_parvo()`.

# epl 0.2.2

* Update EPL Parvo App available [here](https://jem-arnold.shinyapps.io/EPL-Parvo-App/).
     * Required small edits to `read_parvo()` and `format_hmmss()`.
     * Currently outlier detection is hidden. Need to update functionality to create the outlier data table.
* Updates to `test_that` for better coverage.

# epl 0.2.1

* Fix `R-CMD-check.yaml`
* Setup codecov secret token

# epl 0.2.0

* Create `replace_outliers()` to detect and replace local outliers with `NA` or the local median value.
* Create `find_peaks()` to detect peak values within a given timespan, e.g. for finding 30-second VÌ‡O~2~peak.
* Create `theme_epl()` and other `{ggplot2}` helper functions for pretty plotting.
* Create `data.R` with documentation of included example files retrievable with `example_epl()`.
* Remove `time_column` argument for `read_parvo()` since as far as I can tell the time column is always *"TIME"*.
* Website documentation available [here](https://jemarnold.github.io/epl/), including function reference index and vignettes.
* Write custom `Reference/Index` package documentation available [here](https://jemarnold.github.io/epl/reference/index.html).
* Create *"Reading and Cleaning Data"* vignette on common usage of functions. Available [here](https://jemarnold.github.io/epl/articles/reading-and-cleaning-data.html).
* Re-write simplified README pointing to vignette for more details.
* Update `test_that` for new functions.

# epl 0.1.0 internal release

* Initial internal release of development version.
* `read_parvo()` for reading data exported from *"Parvo TrueOne"* metabolic cart.
* `read_tymewear()` for reading data exported from *"Tymewear"* device.
    * currently only method available for *"live"* file export.
* `example_epl()` for retrieving example data files to test read and process functions.
* Undocumented internal validation & helper functions in `helpers.R`.
* Basic README to demonstrate usage for the current three exported functions.
* Unit tests for exported functions.
