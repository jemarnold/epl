\title{Read Parvo Exported CSV Data}
\usage{
read_parvo(file_path, time_column = "TIME", add_timestamp = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{The file path as a character string, including \emph{.csv} or
\emph{.xlsx} file type.}

\item{time_column}{A character string for the time column in the data table.
\emph{Defaults} to \code{time_column = "TIME"}. Used to detect the location of the
data table.}

\item{add_timestamp}{A logical to add a "timestamp" column to the data table
with date-time values, useful for synchronisation with other recordings by
time of day. Precise to Â± 0.5 seconds.}
}
\value{
A list with three \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibbles}.
\itemize{
\item \code{parvo$data} contains the data table.
\item \code{parvo$details} contains the file metadata.
\item \code{parvo$events} contains manual event inputs.
}
}
\description{
Read \emph{.CSV} or \emph{.xlsx} (but not \emph{.XLS}) files exported by \emph{Parvo Medics
TrueOne 2400} and return a list of three data frames with recorded data,
file details, and events.
}
\details{
This function can only parse \emph{.CSV} files exported directly from a Parvo
metabolic cart. \emph{.XLS} exported from Parvo are obsolete and the file
format cannot be read. They must be re-saved as \emph{.xlsx} before reading
with this function.

Data from all exported channels (e.g. \code{c("VO2", "VCO2", "Vt")}) will be
exported as-is.

Additional data columns will be calculated if the required exported data
are present. All energetic calculations are derived from
\emph{Peronnet & Massicotte, 1991. Table of nonprotein respiratory quotient: an update}.

These include:
\itemize{
\item \code{FatOx} and \code{CarbOx} are respective substrate oxidation rates in g/min.
\item \code{O2kJ} and \code{O2kcal} are energy equivalents of oxygen in kJ/L and kcal/L
(kilojoules and kilocalories per litre \code{VO2}), respectively.
\item \code{O2work}, \code{O2power}, and \code{O2energy} are aerobic metabolic work
expenditure, energy expenditure, and power output in kJ/min, kcal/min,
and W (kilojoules per minute, kilocalories per minute, and joules per
second), respectively.
\item \code{O2pulse} is a ratio of \code{VO2} to heart rate (\code{HR}) in ml/min/bpm
(millilitres of \code{VO2} per heart beat).
\item \code{Economy} is a ratio of the oxygen cost of work, in W/L/min (external
power output in watts per litre per minute of \code{VO2})
\item \code{GE} (gross efficiency) is a ratio of external work to internal metabolic
work, as a percent, accounting for \code{VO2} and substrate oxidation (\code{RER}).
\item \code{METS} (metabolic equivalent of task) is a deprecated method of
estimating the oxygen cost of common physically active tasks adjusted
for body mass, relative to resting metabolic rate (approximately 3.5
mL/kg/min), calculated as \code{VO2kg / 3.5}.
