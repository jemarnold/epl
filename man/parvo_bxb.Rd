\title{Parvo breath-by-breath export of cycling interval workout}
\format{
A raw .CSV file with metadata and a primary data table with 16
columns and 1056 rows.
}
\description{
A .CSV file exported from Parvo Medics TrueOne 2400 metabolic
cart with breath-by-breath ventilation and gas exchange data for a
5x 5-minute cycling interval workout.
}
\details{
Session records a 5x 5-min cycling interval workout with the participant
alternating body position between upright training position (\emph{"UP"}) and
aerodynamic racing position (\emph{"RP"}) each work bout. Work bout Borg RPE
were between 14-15.

This session was recorded simultaneously with both Parvo and Tymewear. The
Parvo file start time is accurate to within 1 sec (Â± 0.5 sec precision).
However, the Tymewear timestamps are not all accurate, and are inconsistent
due to a current issue in the recording app.

Interval start and stop events are recorded, along with manually identified
cadence and participant-reported Borg RPE.

Parvo uses a mixing chamber and does not correct for time delay between
when ventilation is recorded at the Pneumotach per breath, and when the
gas exchange from that breath is recorded by the sample line. Therefore,
it is \emph{ONLY} valid to use raw ventilation values exported as
breath-by-breath. Breath-by-breath gas exchange values are \emph{NOT} valid
without additional correction processing.

Heart rate data are not valid.
